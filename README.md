## Introduction
**dev-jobs-insights** is a data mining project written in **Python** with the
main objective of **extracting meaningful insights** from developer job posts.
These insights can help us in getting a more accurate picture of what the
developer job market looks like so we can make better decisions (e.g. what
technologies to focus on to increase our chance of finding a job).

I will show some of the important graphs and maps that are generated so you can
have an idea what the project is all about.

More detailed information can be found from the project's website @

## Data analysis of developer job posts from Stack Overflow
The **main goal** of this project is to extract interesting insights from developer
job posts.

**dev-jobs-insights** is a data mining project written in Python with the main
objective of extracting meaningful insights from developer job posts. These
insights can help us in getting a more accurate picture of what the developer
job market looks like so we can make better decisions (e.g. what technologies to

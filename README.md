## Introduction
**dev-jobs-insights** is a data mining project written in **Python** with the
main objective of **extracting meaningful insights** from developer job posts.
These insights can help us in getting a more accurate picture of what the
developer job market looks like so we can make better decisions (e.g. what
technologies to focus on to increase our chance of finding a job).

I will show some of the important graphs and maps that are generated so you can
have an idea what the project is all about.

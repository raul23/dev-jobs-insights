## Introduction
**dev-jobs-insights** is a data mining project written in **Python** with the main
objective of **extracting meaningful insights** from developer job posts. These
insights can help us in getting a more accurate picture of what the developer
job market looks like so we can make better decisions (e.g. what technologies to
focus on to increase our chance of finding a job).

I will show some of the important graphs and maps that are generated so you can have an idea what the project is all about.

More detailed information can be found from the project's website @ https://raul23.github.io/projects/dev-jobs-insights.html

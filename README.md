## Introduction
**dev-jobs-insights** is a data mining project written in **Python3** with the
main objective of **extracting meaningful insights** from developer job posts.
These insights can help us in getting a more accurate picture of what the
developer job market looks like so we can make better decisions (e.g. what
technologies to focus on to increase our chance of finding a job).

I will show some of the important graphs and maps that are generated so you can
have an idea what the project is all about.

More detailed information can be found from the project's website @
https://raul23.github.io/projects/dev-jobs-insights.html

## Data sources
The data used for generating the different graphs and maps come from **Stack
Overflow**'s developer jobs [website](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) and
[RSS feed](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/feed). Eventually, other sources of
job data from other sites will also be integrated.

Here is a summary of the sources of data used for generating the figures:  

| Sources of data | Stack Overflow's [RSS feed](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/feed) and [jobs website](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) |
|:-------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number of job posts | 1000 |
| Number of companies | 561 |
| Published dates | 2018-09-18 to 2018-09-28 |

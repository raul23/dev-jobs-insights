## Project description
The **dev_jobs_insights** is a *personal* data mining project written in *Python* with the
main objective of extracting meaningful insights from developer job posts. These
insights can help us in getting a more accurate image of what the developer job
market looks like so we can take better decisions (e.g. what technology to focus
on).

Data visualization is an important tool in interpreting data. Thus graphs and maps
are an important aspect of this project as you can see from the multiple graphs
generated so we can see the job market along different dimensions (e.g. salary, 
industries).

## Results
The job posts data was mined from StackOverflow developer job [RSS feed](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/feed)
and [website](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs). The following table presents important
information about the extracted data from the job posts:

**Number of job posts:** 933  
**Published date:** from 2017-09-26 to 2017-10-26 14:40:27-04:00

**NOTE**:
- the number of job posts is small but I intend on integrating more data from 
StackOverflow and other data sources
